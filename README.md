A small tool that monitors college football recruiting predictions and alerts me when there are new ones.

Currently it supports
- 247 Crystal ball
- On3 RPM
- Rivals FutureCast

Built with free services:
- [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) (probably unnecessary and overkill, purely for easy integration with vercel)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (Hosting)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) (Storage)
- [Gmail SMTP](https://kinsta.com/blog/gmail-smtp-server/)
